      Goldydocs provides a single web UI providing visibility into porridge
      temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics! You can even find out
      who’s been eating **your** porridge.


      (Sadly, Goldydocs isn’t a real project, but you can use this site as an
      example to create your own real websites with [Docsy](https://docsy.dev))
