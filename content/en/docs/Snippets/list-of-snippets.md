## Snippets/ Shortcodes

Snippets, also known in Hugo as shortcodes are small reusable pieces of code that you can include in your markdown files.<br><br>Here are some of the ones you can use in Docsy:

### Alert

{{< alert color="danger" title="Warning!" >}}Use these when you want to alert your users to something important!{{< /alert >}}

### Image Processing

Used to process images in the same page bundle.

**TODO:** Need to decide how the image input is going to work, since this snippet only works with images in the local page bundle, not images in the static folder.

### Page Info
{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}Use this snippet when you want to provide information about a page.{{% /pageinfo %}}
